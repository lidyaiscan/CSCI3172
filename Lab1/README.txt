## Getting Started

GitLab Repository Link: https://git.cs.dal.ca/lidya/csci-3172/-/tree/main/Lab1

## Sources Used

No code was copied, re-used, or modified from other sources, but I used the Roboto Condensed font from Google's API: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed?query=Roboto+Condensed#standard-styles

### index.html

*Line 31*

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Condensed:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> 

```

## Acknowledgments

* Although no code was taken from any bootstrap templates, I did browse through some to get inspiration of example "about" pages to see what styles I found appealing.
