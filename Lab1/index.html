			<h2>Personal Info</h2>
			<p>My name is Lidya Iscan-Insense, and I am a fourth year computer science student.
			I was born and raised in Halifax Nova Scotia, but my parents are from Spain and Turkey.
			I have one sister who is 5 years younger than me.</p>

			<h2>Technical Info</h2>
			<p>My main area of interest in computer science is web application development.
			I'm really looking forward to this course and I am excited to learn new things.</p>
			<p>Some of my technical programming skills that I have learned from previous courses such as CSCI 1170 and
			 CSCI 2170 include HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also have experience working with the Angular Framework, so
			 I hope to be able to learn a bit of React this term!</p>
