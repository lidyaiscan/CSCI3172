## Sources Used

Some code that was written was resued and modified from my own work from previous labs.
The js code that was reused and modified to check for prime, composite or neither numbers now includes number 0 and increments the number counters, lines 19-35 in script.js was taken from my Lab4 script, lines 62-77.
The css code that was also reused and modified for my form elements in styles.css was taken from my Lab3 css stylesheet.
